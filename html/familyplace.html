<p>Calories are the basic unit of energy found in all foods and are necessary to maintain the body's vital functions or basal metabolic rate. The amount of calories a person needs depends on factors like their age, gender, and lean muscle mass.</p>

<p>Eating too few calories for a prolonged period of time causes a person to become underweight (per the BMI) leading to muscle atrophy, weakened immunity, and eventually, organ failure. Conversely, eating too many calories causes a person to become overweight and obese, increasing their chances of heart disease, type II diabetes, and cancer.</p>

<p>People looking to gain weight in the form of lean muscle mass can aim to eat around 3000 calories per day depending on how many strength building exercises they are doing.</p>

<p>Healthy high-calorie foods include granola, meats, tofu, fish, avocados, milk, beans, sweet potatoes, whole grains, and nuts. In general, the daily value (%DV) for calories is 2000 calories per day, but people active with strength training or other exercises may want to consume more.</p>

<p>Nova Scotia on Canada’s east coast has a lot to offer visitors of all ages. Base your family in Halifax and take in the city’s outdoor attractions, such as the Public Gardens, Point Pleasant Park, and the Waterfront. Little ones will thrill at the chance of a harbour cruise aboard Theodore Too, Halifax’s famous tugboat.</p>

<p>Take the kids to the playgrounds styled as a submarine and a giant whale, or grab some crispy fish and chips at Bud the Spud, an iconic food truck usually parked on Spring Garden Road. While there, do some high-end souvenir shopping at Jennifer’s of Nova Scotia for tartan-themed items to take home. You may have time to head back to the waterfront for a peek at the harbour city’s tragic past and naval history at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.</p>

				<h2>Cavendish, Prince Edward Island</h2>
Best for: Good value family vacation

<p>A trip to PEI can be a cheap vacation for families who want to camp or stay in budget accommodation. Of course, Cavendish is famous as the home of Anne of Green Gables and summertime is the best time to visit.</p>

<p>Besides visiting Green Gables Heritage Place, there are many low and no-cost things to do on a summer family vacation. The beaches may be red and rough and the sea cold, but on a warm sunny day, they still offer a free place to chill out and let the kids play. There are many national parks on the island, so you may have to pay an entry fee, but it’s usually affordable for all visitors.</p>
