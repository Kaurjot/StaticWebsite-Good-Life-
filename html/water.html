<p>Keeping hydrated is crucial for health and well-being, but many people do not consume enough fluids each day.

Around 60 percent of the body is made up of water, and around 71 percent of the planet’s surface is covered by water.

Perhaps it is the ubiquitous nature of water that means drinking enough each day is not at the top of many people’s lists of priorities.</p>

<h5>Tuna is another low-calorie, high-protein food.</h5>

It’s lean fish, meaning it’s low in fat.

Tuna is popular among bodybuilders and fitness models who’re on a cut, as it's a great way to increase protein intake while keeping total calories and fat low.

If you're trying to emphasize protein intake, make sure to choose tuna canned in water, not oil.

<ul><h7>Here are some reasons our body needs water:</h7>

<li>It lubricates the joints

Cartilage, found in joints and the disks of the spine, contains around 80 percent water. Long-term dehydration can reduce the joints’ shock-absorbing ability, leading to joint pain.</li>

<li>It forms saliva and mucus

Saliva helps us digest our food and keeps the mouth, nose, and eyes moist. This prevents friction and damage. Drinking water also keeps the mouth clean. Consumed instead of sweetened beverages, it can also reduce tooth decay.</li>

<li>It delivers oxygen throughout the body

Blood is more than 90 percent water, and blood carries oxygen to different parts of the body.</li>

<li>It boosts skin health and beauty

With dehydration, the skin can become more vulnerable to skin disorders and premature wrinkling.</li>

<li> It cushions the brain, spinal cord, and other sensitive tissues

Dehydration can affect brain structure and function. It is also involved in the production of hormones and neurotransmitters. Prolonged dehydration can lead to problems with thinking and reasoning.</li>

<li>It regulates body temperature

Water that is stored in the middle layers of the skin comes to the skin’s surface as sweat when the body heats up. As it evaporates, it cools the body. In sport.

Some scientists have suggested that when there is too little water in the body, heat storage increases and the individual is less able to tolerate heat strain.

Having a lot of water in the body may reduce physical strain if heat stress occurs during exercise. However, more research is needed into these effects.</li>

<li>The digestive system depends on it

The bowel needs water to work properly. Dehydration can lead to digestive problems, constipation, and an overly acidic stomach. This increases the risk of heartburn and stomach ulcers.</li>

<li>It flushes body waste

Water is needed in the processes of sweating and removal of urine and feces.</li>
